  /**
 * The MySensors Arduino library handles the wireless radio link and protocol
 * between your home built sensors/actuators and HA controller of choice.
 * The sensors forms a self healing radio network with optional repeaters. Each
 * repeater and gateway builds a routing tables in EEPROM which keeps track of the
 * network topology allowing messages to be routed to nodes.

 *******************************
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * The ArduinoGateway prints data received from sensors on the serial link. 
 * The gateway accepts input on seral which will be sent out on radio network.
 *
 * The GW code is designed for Arduino Nano 328p / 16MHz
 *
 * Wire connections (OPTIONAL):
 * - Inclusion button should be connected between digital pin 3 and GND  
 * - RX/TX/ERR leds need to be connected between +5V (anode) and digital pin 6/5/4 with resistor 270-330R in a series
 *
 * LEDs (OPTIONAL):
 * - To use the feature, uncomment MY_LEDS_BLINKING_FEATURE in MyConfig.h
 * - RX (green) - blink fast on radio message recieved. In inclusion mode will blink fast only on presentation recieved
 * - TX (yellow) - blink fast on radio message transmitted. In inclusion mode will blink slowly
 * - ERR (red) - fast blink on error during transmission error or recieve crc error 
 *
